This blog post is the second of a series of posts describing my experimentation with AWS AppSync, Lambda, and 
DynamoDB. A [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/cebartling/invest-guru) exists with 
[this experiment](https://github.com/cebartling/invest-guru/tree/master/experiments/InvestGuruPrototype1) 
so others can learn from my efforts. Links to the other posts in this series are listed below:
