# GraphQL APIs with AWS AppSync, Lambda and DynamoDB: Part one

This blog post is the first of a series of posts describing my experimentation with AWS AppSync, Lambda, and 
DynamoDB. I really wanted to experiment with AWS AppSync and really dig into it's support for Lambda-based 
resolvers. I also  wanted to ensure that everything I did was through Infrastructure as Code (IaC), so 
I utilized the Serverless Framework for creating all of my resources on AWS. 

A [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/cebartling/invest-guru) exists with this experiment 
so others can learn from my efforts.

## Introduction
