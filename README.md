# Invest Guru

Invest Guru is a series of experiments around building a technical analysis investment research platform. 
It's my journey around learning more about investing and demonstrating various ideas around building an
approachable platform for investment research.

A serverless implementation using AWS technologies: AppSync, Lambda and DynamoDB to name a few of the services
